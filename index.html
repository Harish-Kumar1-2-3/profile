        <h2>Hey There!</h2>
        <p><p>I had completed my grade XII from CS Academy, Erode. I am the son of Prabavathy M V and Vasudevan M S . I have a younger sister too. I had always had a great passion to work with computers and applications from my childhood. I am aiming forward to integrated Computer science and its applications with Sustainable development for future needs. I had secured 479 on 500 in my grade 10 CBSE Examination and had extended it to 481 on 500 in my grade 12 CBSE Examination with all my subject grades as A1 in both years.
        </p>
        <p>I am an active participant in all events happening near me. I am a person displaying positive traits of planning, manifesting, and teamwork. I am the kind of person who never encourages giving up things. I display optimism good leadership skills too. Though I stay challenging on the other hand I am easy-going and fun-loving too. I love travelling and exploring new stuff.

                  My hobbies are drawing,crafting,brush lettering,wall paintings. I also love writing english scripts for Drama,Speech and Debate. Loving and embracing my hobbies had helped me in winning many competitions through my innovative approaches to that scenario.
                    I feel that a person has to be educated through both white and green leaves of a book. Education not only comes by learning what is given in the book.Only if are able to apply holistic knowledge and approach to our tasks provided we can claim that we are well-educated.
